This will be my first game release as a junior game developer.

The game is being rendered through  HTML5 Canvas. I'm trying to expand my Javascript skills with this game.

I learned so many things, like Game Collisions, Map Rendering, Updating position of gameobjects, Rendering foreground objects on top of the characters. I know that I need to improve the way I code in order to make it more organized and readable. If you view the code, there are some static values that need to be refactored to make it more reusable and readable. This is just the first step as a game developer and also a web developer.

If things go on my way, I will update the game and add more features to it.

Add Textbox like the usual RPG
Add other GameObjects like NPC
Add more maps and story
Add Map transition (Changing map to other Map based on the event)
